# Notes

To understand this we need to understand interest of all parties in Pakistan and Pakistani military.

1\. China - Pakistan is most promising market of their defence products. Any war with India is a sales and marketing opportunity for China.

2\. US - US and NATO still have its nuclear war heads and military equipments in Pakistan to counter Chinese and Russians if needed.

Pakistan has not shared this info even with China.

3\. Terror groups- They also use Pakistani arsenals as per the need and in return carry Jihadi assignment for Pakistani Army. There is little or no difference between Army and terrorists.

After Pahalgam attack….

….America NATO and China all were against terror attack.

India destroyed terror camps. They were still more or less neutral.

Pakistan attacked India on May 7-8 and 8-9 all were going well.

China and Turkey were happiest to see Pakistani stock going down so new orders will be placed.

US VP JD Vance mentioned it’s their internal matter.

But ….

Here comes the twist:

May 9-10: India does a brutal counter offensive. Never seen before by India doing such operation.
Neither seen before by the world where one nation bombs 11 airbases of another nuclear armed country.

It included US’s favourable airbase Jacobabad- it was used by US and NATO for operations in Afghanistan.

Strikes included Kirana hills- storage place of US not just Pakistani nuclear warhead, Sargodha airbase- it is station of F-16 jets.

Why US panicked:

US panicked not due to India Pakistan getting into a nuclear war but because:

US was about to be exposed to the world and to Russia and China about presence of its military and nuclear war heads in Pakistan dangerously close to China.

US also panicked…

…because the sales of US made weapons have reduced in Pakistan and Chinese are supplying 82% of Pakistan needs since last 6-7 years.

Attack and destruction of Sargodha resulted into butchering of large number of F-16 jets as well as India has shot down these jets in air fight as well.

That’s why US panicked and forced Pakistan into begging India for ceasefire. And Pakistan Govt thanked US for the same.

Why Chinese are not happy?

China wanted complete wipeout of US presence in Pakistan(military equipments) as they were not aware of US nuclear war heads presence in Pakistan.

And this was the golden opportunity as India was going full throttle.

Chinese govt had everything going their way till the time India attacked a nuclear facility and US blackmailed Pakistan to ceasefire using IMF loan as leverage.

The moment …

Pakistan thanked US for ceasefire. Chinese called on Pakistan Ministers and literally thrashed them as per reports for accepting it.

Because, Chinese had calculated this a multi billion dollar order to their defence companies and wiping out US tech from Pakistani army at the same time.

That’s why you are seeing Indian Chinese toolkits blaming govt, not trusting Indian armed forces and sharing unverified news of Indian jets shot down by Chinese jets of Pakistan.

But why India agreed?

India’s goal was achieved from this mission.
India didn’t intend to hit military targets initially but it had to when provoked.

India sent a message that Pakistan can’t think that their nuclear arsenals are not reachable unlike 1982 aborted mission of Kahuta.

As a responsible nation and understanding Pakistan’s vulnerability, India halted the mission and attacks for the time being.

Earthquakes, radioactivity detection plane, boron containing plane from Egypt and lot more activities are there to explore.
