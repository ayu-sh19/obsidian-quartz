# Notes

- Developed by India’s DRDO and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), in deep integration with ISRO, - AkashTeer is a next-generation real-time targeting and interception system. It is not just one machine or one drone. It’s a system-of-systems that connects satellites, drones, ground radars, mobile war rooms, and AI processors into a self-updating, auto-striking defensive cloud.
- AkashTeer uses live satellite surveillance from ISRO’s Cartosat and RISAT Precision navigation and targeting using India’s NAVIC GPS constellation, which enable real-time targeting and terrain-adaptive decision making. This system bypasses foreign satellites and ensures 100% sovereignty of data, unlike nations who depend on US GPS or French satellite relays.
- The use of India’s NAVIC constellation makes AkashTeer, far more reliable in South Asia than GPS, giving pinpoint accuracy in difficult terrains like mountains and deserts. This gives AkashTeer a local advantage in precision strikes that GPS-guided systems from the US or China often fail to achieve.
- Pakistan Army’s radar and air command centers failed to detect the entry of AkashTeer drones near sensitive zones. Their response systems froze because no known signature or frequency was picked up. This has also crippled confidence in US-supplied AWACS and anti-drone radars.
- AkashTeer’s Plug-and-Strike Deployment – Can be operated from a laptop-size mobile command center even in a moving jeep, which probably makes it best on the Planet.
