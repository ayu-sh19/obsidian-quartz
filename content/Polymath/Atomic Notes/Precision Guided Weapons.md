### Long Range Weapons

![[Pasted image 20250514130857.png]]

#### Akash Air Defence System
-  India’s Indigenous SAM that clipped enemy's wings!
- The Akash is a DRDO-developed medium-range surface-to-air missile system, capable of engaging targets up to 25 km away with high accuracy in all-weather conditions.
- In Operation Sindoor: Akash missiles brought down multiple UAVs and hostile airborne threats near critical bases. Its performance boosted confidence in indigenous air defence and proved that India’s homegrown tech can match imported systems in battlefield efficiency.

#### L70 Anti-Aircraft Gun
- The legacy defender
- The L70 is a radar-guided 40mm anti-aircraft gun originally from Sweden, now upgraded with digital sights and tracking systems to destroy low-flying targets like drones and helicopters.
- In Operation Sindoor: These guns were placed in vulnerable zones in J&K and played a key role in night operations. They brought down several Pakistani quadcopters and loitering munitions trying to breach Indian populated cities during blackouts, acting as the first line of response when radar visibility was limited.

#### S-400
- India’s Strategic Air Shield
- The S-400 is a Russian long-range air defense system capable of detecting and destroying targets up to 400 km away—including aircraft, drones, and ballistic missiles.
- In Operation Sindoor: S-400 units were deployed near the border to create a no-fly zone over Indian airspace. The system successfully detected and intercepted missiles like Fatah-II, fired by Pakistan on Indian cities, ensuring total aerial dominance and shielding offensive assets in real time. Pakistan even attempted to target the system but was unable to get any confirmed hit on any of the battery's component.

#### Rafale with SCALP and Hammer
- The Deep Striker
- The Rafale is a 4.5-gen French multirole fighter. Paired with SCALP cruise missiles (range ~560 km), it can hit high-value targets without entering enemy airspace.
- In Operation Sindoor: Rafales struck terrorist launch pads, headquarters and Pakistan military's key installations, like radar installations and command centres, inpoint precision. The SCALP-enabled strikes were surgical and untraceable, delivering a psychological and operational blow to adversaries.

#### Su-30MKI with BrahMos
- The Supersonic Game-Changer
- India’s Su-30MKI, a twin-jet air superiority fighter, has been upgraded to carry the BrahMos-A—an air-launched variant of the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile.
- In Operation Sindoor: These jets launched BrahMos missiles at strategic infrastructure across the LoC. The strikes caused neutralization of enemy radar stations, damage of airbase infrastructure and affected supply lines. The 300+ km stand-off range allowed these missions to be executed without entering hostile territory.
#### HAROP Loitering Munition
- Kamikaze Drones
- HAROP is an Israeli loitering munition, also known as a kamikaze drone. It loiters over targets, locks onto radar signals or visuals, and dives into them with explosive force.
- In Operation Sindoor: HAROP drones were used for SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) missions, targeting enemy radars and communication nodes. Their stealth, autonomy, and precision allowed them to penetrate the Pakistani air defence and hit their targets deep inside Pakistan.
